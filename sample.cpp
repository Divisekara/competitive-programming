//  in CPP indentation is something the program does not care about. we can have indentation as many as we need as well we can avoid indentation

// this is a function Every computer program starts with a function called main.
// Even in python we start the program using main

//  int  means what types of data we are working with inside this function.

// we can add many functions as we want but only one main function.

int main()

    // inside the curly bracers we have statements. All functions are made of statements.
    // every statement needs to end with semi colan
